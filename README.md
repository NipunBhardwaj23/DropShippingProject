# DropShippingProject
# Drop – Shipping is a retail fulfilment method where the store or the seller doesn’t keep the product it sells in stock. Instead, we just upload the product of our choice on our website/store from a third party or a Wholesale dealer’s store and get that product directly shipped to the customer by the supplier.
